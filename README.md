2048 Sliding Tile Puzzle

Notes:
1)  Pull this code to GitHub Classroom
2)  Change "manifest.yml" to reflect your AU username
    Line 3:  is -> name: umphrda-2048    should be -> name: username-rcube
    where "username" is your AU user name.
3)  "dispatch.py" is the dispatching function for the microservice.  It receives 
the query string portion of the URL in Python dictionary format and routes it to
methods that are stubbed.  You should not have to modify dispatch.py; you _will_,
ultimately, have to modify the stubbed methods. 
4)  Place your production code in the body of the "Tiles2048" directory.
5)  Place your test code in the "test" directory
